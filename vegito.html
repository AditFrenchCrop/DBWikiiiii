        <p class="description">Vegito (ベジット Bejitto), also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga, is the resulting fusion between Goku and Vegeta by the use of the Potara earrings. Vegito wields tremendous power, and like his Fusion Dance counterpart Gogeta, he is regarded as one of the mightiest warriors in the entire Dragon Ball franchise.

            Vegito first appeared at the end of "Union of Rivals" to start battling with Super Buu, with his second appearance in the next episode "Meet Vegito" as the main protagonist throughout the entire episode. His debut in Dragon Ball Super was many years later to fight and attempt to defeat Fused Zamasu, though they quickly defused due to over-usage of power.</p>

        <p class="description">Gogeta (ゴジータ Gojīta) is the Metamoran fusion of Goku and Vegeta when they perform the Fusion Dance properly. Wielding the combined and magnified strength of both Goku and Vegeta, Gogeta is an incredibly deadly warrior, and like his Potara counterpart Vegito, he is regarded as one of the most powerful characters in the entire Dragon Ball franchise.

            Gogeta first debuted in Fusion Reborn as the final protagonist when Goku and Vegeta fused in Hell to defeat Super Janemba. He returned in Dragon Ball GT as a Super Saiyan 4 to battle Omega Shenron, but defused quicker than expected due to over-using too much power. He would then make his canonical debut in Broly as the film's final protagonist, similar to his role from Fusion Reborn.</p>
